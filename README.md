## Travelling Dealer Problem Solution

### Problem Description

In this example we’re going to help a dealer in order to reduce the cost of his/her sale operaon.
As you may noce, Image‑1 represents the customers (8 units) and a factory. 
Dealer should travel to his/her customers by using the shortest path. The dealer must visit the factory aer every customer visitaon.
We need to calculate the total distance that dealer need to travel in order to visit each customer.
You should implement your own data structure(LinkedList) with the help of the project that was shared with you.
You can implement it either in Kotlin or Java. By compleng “todos” in the project you can solve the travelling
dealer problem. (Check out project skeleton)

Store each shortest path in your own Node. Then, by implemenng the “sumOfNodes” method you could
solve the problem. At the end clean all nodes by implemenng “deleteNode” method.
